# ShinyApp-Two-Horse-Race-Model
Shiny application for simulating the Two Horse Race Model

This model is used explain how response inhibition works in the stop-signal paradigm. In the stop-signal paradigm, a subject is given a primary task and sometimes a stop signal is given telling the subject not to complete the primary task. The stop-signal task is used as a measure of response inhibition (impulse control), which is useful for studying impulse-control diseases like ADHD, OCD, or schizophrenia. The two horse race model proposes that a go process and stop process are racing, and whichever process finishes first will be executed. If the go process wins, the response happens, and if the stop process happens, the response is inhibited. Depending on when the stop signal occurs, the outcome of the race is some probability. For example, the earlier the stop signal occurs, the higher the probability of the action being inhibited.

This simulation shows how mean reaction time (mRT), standard deviation (SD), and stop signal 
reaction time (SSRT) impact the model. You can view up to six delays at once. Setting a delay
slider to 1 will exclude that delay from the graphs.
